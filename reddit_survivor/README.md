### Project Overview

Survivor is a competition reality TV show run since 1997. Contestants,
or "castaways," are marooned on remote islands around the world.
Castaways compete in various challenges for rewards and immunity, fighting
for the title of "Sole Survivor" and its $1 million award. Contestants are
eliminated through votes by fellow castaways each week.

Survivor has a wide-reaching, diverse fanbase. Fans love to discuss
player strategies, unique personalities, weekly challenges, and guess
winners. The vibrant Reddit community, r/survivor, is very active.

r/survivor Redditors love data! Before each season airs, r/survivor
members participate in a survey to predict the season's Sole Survivor.
Voters are asked to guess who the season's Sole Survivor will be.
These predictions are based on pre-impressions. Voters have access only
to castaways' names, ages, occupations, city of residence, and gender. After
each episode premieres, moderators reveal the number of votes the
eliminated contestant received.

I love Survivor, and I'm a data nerd! I was curious to see if the
distribution of winner prediction votes differed. Did winners have
a higher number of votes than losers?

### Methods

I gathered winner prediction survey results from the r/survivor *Winner
Pick Statistics* threads. These results are available under the *season
archive* bookmark. Data was available for seasons 31 - 47, with the 
exception of season 44.

Each season had its own discussion thread (some more complete than
others). For some seasons, winner prediction survey results for each
castaway were neatly summarized in Google sheets by moderators. For others, 
data were manually recorded from each episode's *Winner Pick Statistics* 
thread. I entered all these winner predictions in a spreadsheet,
survivor_winner_predictions.xlsx.

I merged this dataframe with data from the SurvivoR dataset. This dataset was
created by [dohem](https://github.com/doehm) and is available for
download via [GitHub](https://github.com/doehm/survivoR)! It included
information about contestant demographics, winner status, challenge
results, and more. Data for seasons 1 - 44 were available.

After merging the two datasets, data for 13 seasons were available. I
analyzed *Winner Pick Statistics* for seasons 31 (my favorite) through
43. I examined the distribution of winner prediction votes for each
castaway, per season. The distribution of votes across all available
seasons was also generated.

I performed a Mann Whitney test to determine if winners had a different
amount of votes than losers.

I decided to build a R Shiny dashboard to share my findings with the
r/survivor community. THE DASHBAORD CONTAINS SPOILERS!

### Findings

My analysis revealed:

- Castaways predicted to win had a higher median number of votes than those who didnâ€™t win.
- There was a statistically significant difference in the number of votes between winners and losers.

These results suggest r/survivor Redditors have the potential to correctly identify potential winners!

### Limitations

The availability of data for this analysis was limited; I evaluated data
from 13 seasons out of 47. It is possible these 13 seasons are not
representative of the entire Survivor franchise. Additionally, I chose
to examine U.S. Survivor seasons only.

Due to the limited sample size, there were only 13 winners. The small
amount of positive cases could have led to bias. Due to this small
sample size of winners, I was reluctant to perform statistical modelling
that may have been inaccurate. Resulting models would have likely
struggled to predict winners and have poor sensitivity.
