## Data Scientist

Hello, welcome to my GitHub! You can view my projects and resume here. 

### Bio
I am an epidemiologist-turned-data-scientist. I have a passion for applying data science technologies to improve health! My background in epidemiology has equipped me with a deep understanding of disease dynamics, real world evidence (RWE), mathematical and statistical modeling, and clinical research. I enjoy communicating these domains to diverse audiences (lay people, researchers, and clinicians) via compelling data storytelling.
